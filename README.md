In this game prototype I used simple cones to perpesent production buildings. In the bottom left corner there is a square (it should be replaced with an image of a building in a real game). You need to simply drag and drop this square to construct a building. After spawning a building, a bar appears above the cone. Is shows the filling of the building with resource. To collect the resource you need to tap on this bar. In the top left corner there is a text box, which shows how much resource do you have.
